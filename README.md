List of Python scripts:
All scripts were done in Anaconda 3.7 with Numpy, Pandas, pyABF, pyPNG and Bokeh.

pyABF: https://pypi.org/project/pyabf/

pyPNG: https://pypi.org/project/pypng/

Demo_EntropyByWordsLetters.py: 

Python script made to demonstrate the impact of quantization and sampling (parameters v and T) on the calculation of entropy.

BatchHsHnFromFile.py:

Main script to calculate all the possible values of entropy according to the T, v and Size parameters.
This will ask for a list of abf or csv data files and will create an Excel Spreadsheet with all Hs & Hn values for each data file.

PlotHsHnFromExcel.py:

This will take the HS & Hn Excel files created by BatchHsHnFromFile.py, plot the values and perform the 3 quadratic extrapolations.
The final values of Rs and Rn will be used to calculate I = Rs - Rn.

Main_Entropy_Module.py:

Main Module to calculate Entropy by the direct way with correction of the sampling bias. This is needed by the two previous scripts.

BatchSaveAsPNG.py:

This script will convert csv or abf files to PNG, save a direct file and a transposed copy and log the PNG Rates (file sizes divided by the number of pixels in the image) in an Excel file.

GenerateRandomNoise.py:

This will create Gaussian White noise and sort it or not. Then save it as a csv, for later analyze of Hs & Hn or save it as PNG.

Labview Scripts were made using Labview 2017 and Vision 2017.

They are mainly used for figures 2B, 3C and 4B. See the top level vi in the llb for description.
